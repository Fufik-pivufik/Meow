# Meow
This is a little application for replace cat and wc, but cuter.

# installation

First you need clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Fufik-pivufik/Meow
cd Meow
```

## And now you have two ways!
If you're using cls(c language support) then just use command build
```
cls build
```

But if you're not using cls(you could install it from my profile)
Use installation script
```
./install
```

And for check that installation completed correctly you can just call it
```
meow
```
Or call help for meow
```
meow -h
```
